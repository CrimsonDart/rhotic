These are the terms that will be used in the Rhotic Text Editor.

### Window
A window is the part of the screen that displays the rhotic program.

### Stage 
A stage is the emacs equivalent of a mode. A Stage can be anything from a text buffer, where you edit text, to a graphical interface.

### Package
A Package can be thought of as a mini program that can be installed within Rhotic. Just like emacs or any linux package manager.

### Store
Where packages can be downloaded, and thus installed.

# Minibuffer
The minibuffer is a little text bar at the bottom of the window, (not stage window) where the command being entered shows.
It also shows other status information.
